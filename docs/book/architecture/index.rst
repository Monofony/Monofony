Architecture
============

.. note::

    This section is based on the great `Sylius documentation <http://docs.sylius.com>`_.

Before we dive separately into every Monofony concept, you need to have an overview of how our main application is structured.
In this chapter we will sketch this architecture and our basic, cornerstone concepts, but also some supportive approaches,
that you need to notice.
