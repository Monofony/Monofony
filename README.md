Monofony is an Open Source micro-framework on top of [**Symfony**](https://symfony.com) & [**Sylius**](https://sylius.com).

It allows you to use great Sylius packages in a non-commerce Symfony project, with [Resource](https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusResourceBundle) & [Grid](https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusGridBundle) bundles.

You'll be able to use a full-stack Behaviour-Driven-Development with [phpspec](https://phpspec.net) and [Behat](http://behat.org). 
Cause most of the code is coming with Symfony flex recipes, the files are yours, and you'd be able to customize everything easily.
