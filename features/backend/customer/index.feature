@ui @backend @customer @index
Feature: View list of customers
    In order to manage customers
    As an administrator
    I need to be able to view all the customers

    Background:
        Given there are customers:
            | email             |
            | kevin@example.com |
        Given there are admin users:
            | email             | password |
            | admin@example.com | password |
        And I am logged in on administration as user "admin@example.com" with password "password"

    Scenario: View list of customers
        When I am on "/admin/customers/"
        Then I should see "kevin@example.com"
