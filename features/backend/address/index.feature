Feature: View list of addresses
    In order to manage addresses
    As an administrator
    I need to be able to view all the addresses

    Background:
        Given there are admin users:
            | email             | password |
            | admin@example.com | password |
        And there are 5 addresses located at "Rennes"
        And I am logged in on administration as user "admin@example.com" with password "password"

    Scenario: View list of addresses
        When I am on "/admin/addresses/"
        Then I should see "Rennes"
