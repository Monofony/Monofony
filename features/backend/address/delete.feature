Feature: Remove address
    In order to manage addresses
    As an admin
    I need to be able to remove addresses

    Background:
        Given there are admin users:
            | email             | password |
            | admin@example.com | password |
        And there are addresses:
            | city   |
            | Rennes |
        And I am logged in on administration as user "admin@example.com" with password "password"

    Scenario: Remove an address
        Given I am on "/admin/addresses/"
        When I press "Supprimer"
        Then I should see "a bien été supprimée"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Remove a address with modal
        Given I am on "/admin/addresses/"
        When I press "Supprimer"
        And I wait until modal is visible
        And I press confirm button
        Then I should see "a bien été supprimée"
