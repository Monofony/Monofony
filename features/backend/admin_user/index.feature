Feature: View list of admin users
    In order to manage admin users
    As an administrator
    I need to be able to view all the admin users

    Background:
        Given there are admin users:
            | email                  | password |
            | admin@example.com      | password |
            | hale.ceane@example.com | password |
        And I am logged in on administration as user "admin@example.com" with password "password"

    Scenario: View list of admin users
        When I am on "/admin/users/"
        Then I should see "hale.ceane@example.com"
